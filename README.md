## Requirements

Wappsto-cli requires node version `16.4.0` or higher to work properly.

## Install

First create a new folder for you wapp and enter it.

```shell
mkdir my-new-wapp
cd my-new-wapp
```

You can now install the package with `npm`.

```sh
npm install wappsto-cli --save-dev
```

Or using `yarn`.

```sh
yarn add wappsto-cli -D
```

When use `yarn` remember to create a `package.json` file in your folder before installing.

```sh
echo '{}' > package.json
```

## Usage

### Create

To create a Wapp run the `wapp create` using `npx`:

```sh
npx wapp create
```

It will ask for your 'username' and 'password' to Wappsto, unless you are already logged in.
Here you get the option to download any existing Wapps or create a new Wapp.

This will generate a file called manifest.json where you can modify the description of your wapp.

### Run

To start a local web server and local background runner, that will serve the Wapp run the `wapp serve` using `npx`:

```sh
npx wapp serve
```

This will run a local web server where you can test your wapp foreground part of your wapp. It is default listen on port 3000.
This will also run your background files in a local node instance.
Any notifications from your Wapp is presented in the terminal where you are running `wapp serve`.
If you want to run your background files on the server, you can use the `--remote` flag when starting `wapp serve`.

### Configure

To configure your wapp you can run `wapp configure` using `npx`, to change some settings for your wapp.
This is also where you can create OAuth configurations for your wapp.

```sh
npx wapp configure
```

### Update

To update the Wapp on wappsto run the `wapp update` using `npx`:

```sh
npx wapp update
```

This will upload all your files to Wappsto and download any new files created for your Wapp.

### Publish

To publish the Wapp to the Wappsto Store run the `wapp publish` using `npx`:

```sh
npx wapp publish
```

This will make your wapp available in the store for other people to use.

### Delete

To delete the Wapp run the `wapp delete` using `npx`:

```sh
npx wapp delete
```

This will delete your Wapp locally and/or remotely.

### Reinstall

To trigger a reinstall of the application run:

```sh
npx wapp update --reinstall
```

## Configuration

You can configure wappsto-cli by creating a 'wappsto.json' file and add this:

 "foreground": "foreground",
 "background": "background",
 "port": "3000"
}
```

| Option     | Default      | Description                                                                  |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| foreground | `foreground` | The folder where the foreground files will be stored.                        |
| background | `background` | The folder where the background files will be stored.                        |
| port       | `3000`       | The port the web server will serve the Wapp on.                              |
| browser    | `default`    | The browser used to serve the frontend files. ('google-chrome' or 'firefox') |

## Frameworks

Here is some examples on how to configure frameworks to work with wappsto-cli.

### React

If you are using React framework, you can [configure](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development#configuring-the-proxy-manually) the React development server, by installing the following package:

```sh
npm install http-proxy-middleware --save
```

and creating a file `src/setupProxy.js` with this:

```js
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');
const wappsto = require('wappsto-cli');

const HOST = wappsto.getHost();
let sessionID = '';

const run = async () => {
  sessionID = await wapp.getSession();
};
run();

module.exports = function (app) {
  app.use(
    '/services',
    createProxyMiddleware({
    target: HOST,
    changeOrigin: true,
    ws: true,
    logLevel: 'error',
  }));

  // set a cookie
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.cookie('sessionID', sessionID, { maxAge: 900000 });
    next();
  });
};
```

And insert `"homepage": "./",` into your `package.json` file.

To use the build version of React, change the `foreground` configuration to `build` and then run `npm run build` to build the react application.
Then run `npx wapp serve` to serve the build version of your react application.
